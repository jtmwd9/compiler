I apologize that this is so late. I was falling behind due to academic and personal issues, so I needed to take advantage of your generous
late policy in this course. My tree doesn't print perfectly. It is supposed to print one level per line in pre order, but I had a little trouble
coding when to print on a new line. It is still readable, and I don't think it will affect future projects.
